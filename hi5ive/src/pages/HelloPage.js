  <h1>About HI5IVE</h1>
  <p>Have you ever felt isolated and secluded when trying to enjoy your favorite activities?
    Now you can reach out and simply Hi5ive’d someone with the same interests.
    With Hi5ive, we aim to connect users on a deeper level based on their common interests and hobbies.
    Before the popularity of technology,making friends was just by a matter of convenience.
     Most of our friends either went to the same school or grew up in the same neighborhood.
      Times have changed and the more we connect with our devices the harder it is to find actual human interaction.
      We want to leverage these devices to encourage face to face human interaction with the Hi5ive application.
